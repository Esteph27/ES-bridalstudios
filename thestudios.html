            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p class="float-right">Here at ES Bridal studios, we seek inspiration not from the runway, but from your dreams. To us, they’re so much more than stories or images. They are your truth. A form of self expression.

                Whether you know what you want and have the Pinterest board to prove it or need a little guidance, Esteph is here to design the dress you see in your dreams. You don’t have to “wake up”.

            <h1>The Designer</h1>
            <p class="float-right">Born and raised in Lima Peru, Esteph has been designing dresses since she was five. 

                Today in London, she’s excited to see bridalwear change for good — with the modern woman unapologetically breaking tradition. Teasing with it.
                
                At the heart of her Bespoke and Design Make service is trust and transparency. By getting to know you — the complex, complicated, crazy human that you are —  she can create the dress of your wildest dreams.

            <h1>Ethos</h1>
            <p class="float-right">Your wedding dress deserves the upmost care and attention. 
                But so does our planet. 
                
                To do our bit, we recycle and upcycle fabric and materials where possible, and choose to work with small suppliers to support communities in unique corners of the world; which we find adds a special character and charm to your already stunning dress. </p>

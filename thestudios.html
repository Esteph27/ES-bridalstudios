            <p>Here at ES Bridal studios, we seek inspiration not from the runway, but from your dreams.
                To us, they’re so much more than stories or images. They are your truth. 
                A form of self expression.

            <p> Born and raised in Lima Peru, Esteph has been designing dresses since she was five.

                <br>
                Today in London, she’s excited to see bridalwear change for good — with the modern woman
                unapologetically breaking tradition. Teasing with it.

            <h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
            <p>By it’s very nature, a wedding dress is an unsustainable garment. However, as a studio,
                we strive to design something so special that you’ll cherish it forever. Perhaps, passing
                it down generations or wearing it more than once. We also work with small suppliers, 
                near and far, and recycle and upcycle fabrics to reduce our waste where we can.
            </p>
            <h2>DIVERSITY</h2>
            <p>Based out of London with it’s rich diversity and proud openness towards people of all faiths, 
                nationalities and backgrounds, we welcome anyone and everyone through our doors. 
                “She”, “He”, “They”, “Ze”... you can bring your whole self to the studio!
            </p>
            <h2>QUALITY</h2>
            <p>Only the highest quality fabrics will touch your skin. Think Italian silk and French lace.</p>
            <h2>RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
            <p>We are deeply committed to our craft, and feel an obligation to create nothing short of your dream dress. 
                Not close enough, not almost, it. 
            </p>
            <h2>TRANSPARENCY</h2>
            <p>In order to walk down the aisle in the dress of your dreams, we must be crystal clear in our plans and promises.
                Being a small studio, we will talk to you like a friend. An open, communicative and accountable friend. 
            </p>
            <h2>HONESTY</h2>
            <p>Designers must never stay silent when it matters most. If the dress needs some tweaking, we will say.
                And vice versa. If you’re not over the moon, you can tell us and we’ll make it right.  
            </p>

            <p>Founder and designer Esteph Standen is inspired by you, the modern bride,
                ignoring dangerous phrases like <em>“be realistic”.</em>

                <br>
                Through her bespoke tailored approach, Esteph asks you to trust her with your deepest, darkest secrets to create a dress that
                says it <em>all</em>. With traditional techniques, a thorough understanding of your needs and intelligent creativity, she sews your hopes,
                dreams and fears into every fold of fabric.

            </h1>
            <p> To do our bit, we recycle and upcycle fabric and materials where possible, and choose to work 
                with small suppliers to support communities close to home and in unique corners of the world;
                which we find adds a special character and charm to your already stunning dress.

            <h1>Her Story</h1>
            <p>Boutique after boutique, Paige had tried on the same glitzy and lacey dress 
                that left her feeling uncomfortable. She came to E.S Bridal Studios hoping for an “aha” moment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Wanting a contemporary, feminine yet demure dress, she dreaded having to wear something
                she wouldn’t normally, for the sake of the big day. She wanted to feel relaxed and most importantly, <em>herself.</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                Together, we achieved this stunning look with it’s subtle nod to Paige’s flirty side, while 
                still classy and ethereal.

# ES Bridal Studios 

## Welcome to E.S Bridal Studios. The website for the modern Bride and Designer. 

This project came about last year when my best friend was hunting for the perfect dress for her big day. She was looking for a bespoke gown, however the hunt for this service was very demotivating; the majority of the websites she came across seemed out-dated in style, provided lengthily information and visual unappealing. My friend was left feeling unmotivated and ended up looking else where for this service. So E.S Bridal studios was born. 

This website is made for both the bride who has no limits and for the designer that can adhere to those demands. A website that captures the spirit of femininity whilst breaking free from tradition. The aim of the website is to inform, encourage the user to book a consultation and as well as promote the business of the designer.

# USERS

This website was made with two users in mind; 1. A wedding dress designer and 2. A future bride. Both with a shared end goal of getting a bespoke dress. The purpose of the website is to expand the designer’s business online, whilst encouraging the end user to book a consultation. Here are a few user scenarios;

## User 1; Wedding Dress Designer

This user has a bridal business who either has an existing website and wants to update/revamp their site to something modern, more user friendly, visually impactful as well as improve their SEO’s. Or, doesn’t have a website and wants to use this website as a template to launch their business online. The aim for both scenarios is to further promote their services online, invite potential clients to book a consultation via the website and ultimately, get a new paying client. 

## User 2; Bride-to-Be

This user is looking for a designer/brand/company who offers a bespoke wedding dress service and wants to book a consultation. The purpose of the website for this user is; to inform them on what the bespoke service entails, provide an indication on price, introduce the designer, outline company ethos and allow them to book a consultation via the from provided.

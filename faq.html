            <h2>Q: I’m not sure after the consultation. What do I do?</h2>

            <p>Don’t worry! The consultation is non-obligatory. You are more than welcome to sleep on it or to say
            then and there that, upon reflection, you’d like to use a different service. We understand. It has to feel right.</p>
        
            <h2>Q: How many fittings will I need?</h2>
            <p>This often varies, but at least 2-3.</p>
            
            <h2>Q: When it’s ready, how do I collect my dress?</h2>
            <p>You’re free to take your dress home after the final fitting, pick it up from the studio another day, or, have
            it delivered to your home via a secure courier which is always on us.</p>
            
            <h2>Q: Where is the studio?</h2>
            <p>We’re in East London, in the Royal Docks (please see our contact page for our address).</p> 
            
            <h2>Q: How much does everything cost?</h2>
            <p>Prices start from £2,500. We can discuss your budget in the consulation to inform fabric and design decisions.</p>
            
            <h2>Q: How long does it take?</h2>
            <p>This also varies but between 6-10 months.</p>

            <h2>Q: What fabrics do you use?</h2>
            <p>We only work with the highest quality fabrics such as 100% silk. Regarding any skin intolerances,
            let’s discuss options in your consulation!</p>

            <h2>Q: I don’t want to pay £80 for a consultation, can I skip it?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, not. It’s very important that you make an informed decision when choosing a studio.
            Designing a wedding dress is a journey, and the consulation is crucial for a successful, enjoyable one.</p>

            <h2>Q: What is your refund policy?</h2>
            <p>As every dress is made to your exact requirements, they are non refundable, However, since you’re there for
            every stage of the design process, there are no surprises.</p>

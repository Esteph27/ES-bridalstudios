            <p>Either in studio or virtually, she will be getting to know you, listening to your initial ideas and answering any
                questions you may have. Everything from accessories, fabrics, silhouettes, colour schemes and the dress’ functionality

                the perfect fit and provide you with a quote. (From here onwards for accuracy, you should try
                to bring along the shoes and undergarments you’ll be wearing on the big day).

            <p>It’s time for those sketches to come to life! Esteph will have now produced a dress
                designers call a “toile” which is a mockup of your dress, normally made in an alternative fabric.
            </p>
            <p>For the first time, you’ll see the shape and siluotte of the dress on your body to start
                making size-specific adjustments. Small design features can also be changed at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>During the next two to three fittings (more if necessary), Esteph will evaluate
                the smallest of details to achieve perfection. By now, your dress will be taking it’s form
                and will have been cut and made using the final fabrics.

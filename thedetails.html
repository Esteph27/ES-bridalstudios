            <p>Everything is overseen by Esteph herself. The service consists of five stages:</em></p>

            <br>
            <p>A 1-1 meeting with Esteph to talk through your dress to understand your vision (or lack of).</p>
            <p>Either in studio or virtually, she will be getting to know you, listening to your initial ideas and answering any
                questions you may have. Everything from accessories, fabrics, silhouettes, colour schemes and the dress’ functionality
                can be discussed. (Many clients find it helpful to bring pictures to this meeting to help them explain their ideas.
                There’s no such thing as too many!)</p>

            <p> During this follow up consulation, Esteph will check in with you, discuss your design in more detail and provide you with a quote.
                With both parties happy to continue, we will take a 50% deposit*. 
            </p>
            <p>We'll also take your measurements for the perfect fit and from 
                here onwards for accuracy, you should try to bring along the shoes and undergarments you’ll be wearing on the big day.</p>

            <p>Sketches of your dress have been drawn and it’s time to take a look!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you’re happy with the design, the fabric, trim and embellishment sourcing begins.
                Esteph will gather a selection of potentials which you’ll try on in the next fitting.

            <p>It’s time for those sketches to come to life! Esteph will have now produced a dress
                designers call a “toile” which is a mockup of your dress, normally made in an alternative fabric.
            </p>
            <p>For the first time, you’ll see the shape and siluotte of the dress on your body to start
                making size-specific adjustments. Small design features can also be changed at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>During the next two to three fittings (more if necessary), Esteph will evaluate
                the smallest of details to achieve perfection. By now, your dress will be taking it’s form
                and will have been cut and made using the final fabrics.

            <p>The final fitting is one last close inspection to ensure everything is just right.</p>
            <p>On this day, your dress is ready for collection.</p>
            <p class="small-print">Please note: we kindly ask for your Final Fitting to be booked at least 3 weeks before your wedding day.</p>
